Title: Implementation of a Solar Power based IoT system for social distance & finding the position of any products in Logistics or Superstores.

This report aims to present a cost-effective and open source IoT solution using the solar power to easily locate the positions of any products stored in a 
super store or logistic store which eliminates time consumption and provides a comfortable way by using smartphone. The concept of the IoT solution is based on 
open source and low cost technology in sensing, data acquisition, processing and transmission system using Arduino board, ESP8266 module, IR (infrared) sensors, 
4 channel relay module, buck-boost converter connected with solar panel and smartphone with a developed android app. The app also counts the number of visitors inside the store
when the IR sensors detect the obstacles by the visitors.
